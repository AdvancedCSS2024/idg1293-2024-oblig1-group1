# Oblig1 Group 1 Report 
*Mia and Sanna*

We started by dividing the work between us. Sanna was responsible for screenshot 2, and Mia was for screenshot one. Then we began pointing out the components of the website we drew them on here:

## Screenshot 1:
In the first screenshot, we found out that the search-bar was an input that contained two buttons: a search button and then a map button. The card component was built up with a heart-button, img, price, subtitle-location, and lastly a title.

## Screenshot 2:
In the second screenshot, we found a card. The card was built up by a top bar and a form with two inputs and then a checkbox and two buttons. We also identified some colours like the “primary-blue” and “marble,” which are colours from Finn’s design system. We also established that the fonts they were using were Finn’s own font, but we did not write that down.

We did the Oblig backwards by accident and started directly working on HTML structure and BEM. Once we had our structure done, we started on the SCSS. We created colour variables to use in the future and added just the base CSS, which included the fonts, to both of our branches. Later on, we also added the defined font sizes and line-height and assigned those to their respected headings.

Once we were 90% done with our pages, we tried to merge them into the branch “mia&sanna” as a test for when we would merge things into main. It worked, so we merged our separate branches into main. Lastly, we added our components together on the demo page, adding basic styling to showcase our components nicely.
